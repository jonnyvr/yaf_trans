# Why to do

 Actually my purpose is very simple.   
 Framework yaf source code is written by C, when reading its code, it seems a little bit diffcult for the guy who do not familar with C, and even if master of C, you should learn HOW TO WRITE PHP EXTENSION at first. If just want to understanding the logic of the framework, it will waste some time at early stage for learning the necessary knowledage.  
 so, a few days earlier, when i read the yaf source code, suddenly the ideal came into my mind.
